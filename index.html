            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal showcase, Lam's Lab! I am a developer in training with a rough background in tech. I worked at a family owned auto shop through most of high school. After high school I enlisted in the Marine Corps where I trained as a ground radio repair technician. This would leave me to grow a relationship where I found that I enjoyed learning the inner workings of communication systems. This carried over after my time in the Marine Corps and lead me to get a job at the Utah State Prison before transitioning to their communications branch where I would learn more about networking as well as cellular and RF communication systems. I enjoy cooking, video games, and hiking. I have a dog and two cats. My goals with this are to further my own personal development into a career that's fulfilling where I can exercise creativity while simultaneously solving problems.
